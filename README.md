  This is a simulated dataset exploring how lifestyle habits affect academic performance in students. With 1,000 synthetic student records and 15+ features including study hours, sleep patterns, social media usage, diet quality, mental health, and final exam scores, itâ€™s perfect for ML projects, regression analysis, clustering, and data viz. Created using realistic patterns for educational practice.

  Ever wondered how much Netflix, sleep, or TikTok scrolling affects your grades? ðŸ‘€ This dataset simulates 1,000 students' daily habitsâ€”from study time to mental healthâ€”and compares them to final exam scores. It's like spying on your GPA through the lens of lifestyle. Perfect for EDA, ML practice, or just vibing with data while pretending to be productive.

  This notebook is my final project in Data Analytics 2025 at ReDI School of Digital Integration in Berlin.
